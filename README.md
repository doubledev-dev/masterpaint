## üöÄ Project Structure

Inside of this Masterpaint project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ astro.config.mjs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json

some prettier & eslint stuffs
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

`src/components/` = where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

>‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Above this messages are the necessary informations.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

using `pnpm` for node pkg manager.
